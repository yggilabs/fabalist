# Fabulist

## Welcomed travelers

Many smaller communities make do without the services a city-dweller may take for granted. Engineers, mechanics, lawyers and all manner of specialized professions rarely exist on the boundaries of civilization. So, when the familiar sound of the wandering Fabulist passing through town is heard, everyone seems to take notice. 

## More than performers

Most recognize a Fabulist by the gathered crowd of excited onlookers. It's easy to understand why outsiders think of them as simple entertainers. In reality, Fabulists are the memory and the will of the people. They are the chroniclers of deeds, the keepers of names and the voices of reason.

## Telling your tale

A Fabulist's work is never done. They possess the knowledge of uncountable tales in their repertoire yet, they live to find the next one. Whether negotiating a treaty between warring kingdoms or delving into the underground laboratory of a long-forgotten lich, Fabulists seek out grand adventure in the hopes of finding their next great story.

## Creating a  Fabulist

As you make your Fabulist character, think about the traditions of your predecessors. Were you born into this way of life or did you join as you came of age? Did you have a teacher to tell you the stories of old? Did you stumble upon a lost story, forcing  this gift upon you?

Consider why you have joined with other adventurers.  Did you seek aid in finding a bigger story?  Did you find someone who you've told tales of? What will be your contribution to the stories passed down after you?

As a someone who has spent so much traveling, you  are often able to use your outsider perspective to your advantage. Fabulists are often chaotic in nature, choosing to follow their own gut and Fabulist traditions over the rules of mainstream society.

### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

* any simple weapon
* (a) a diplomat’s pack or (b) an entertainer’s pack
* a set of tools used to tell your stories
* (a) fang of the serpent or (b) quilt of many squares or (c) gloves of shadow puppets. See items at the end of this document.

### Spellcasting

**Fabulist's Touch**

You may spend one hour to perform the Fabulist's bond ritual on one object held for the duration, this ritual may be performed during a short rest. You have a general sense of the direction towards any bonded item more than 60 feet away. Your bond is broken if you spend an hour casting a ritual to break the bond, you die or, the bonded item is more than 60 feet away from you for 1 hour.

You may bond to a number of items equal to your charisma modifier (minimum 1). If you attempt to bond to additional items, you must choose another bond to break as part of the bonding ritual.

**Ritual Casting**

You can learn magic rituals using your Fabulist's tools. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class’s spell list (the two needn’t be from the same list). The spells are recorded using your Fabulist's tool. Using your Fabulist's tool, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can’t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by some other means.

On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Fabulist's tool. See downtime activities at the end of this document.

### Pattering Speech

You have honed your craft to a point where others find it difficult to resist listening.

As an action, choose one creature within 60 feet. If the creature can hear you (it need not understand you), it must make a charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature is marked by you until the end of your next turn. You may choose to deal your resonance die as psychic damage to any creature marked this way. A creature you have already marked with this feature automatically fails this saving throw. A creature may choose to fail this saving throw.

When you use this feature at higher levels you may choose other additional creatures: one additional creature at 5th, two at 11th and three at 17th.

**Pattering speech save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

### Draw a crowd

Gathering the attention of everything around you is second nature.

If you used *pattering speech* as an action this turn, you may use it again as a bonus action. This additional use of pattering speech can only affect one target.

### A Tale for any Occasion

No matter what obstacles come, you have likely heard a tale to help out.

When you finish a short or long rest, choose any skill. You are proficient in that skill. Then choose any skill you are proficient in, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses this skill. These bonuses last until you use this feature again.

### The Stories Come to Life

Beginning at 2nd level, you bring your stories to life by manifesting a character from a story in the real world.

When you spend ten minutes telling a story, an avatar appears within 30 feet of you. Your avatar has no statistics and cannot interact with any objects. Any creature with a Charisma Score of 7 or higher, can immediately tell this creature is insubstantial. Any interaction with your avatar also reveals its nature. Your avatar can take the form of a humanoid or beast of size medium or small.

Once on your turn, you may move your avatar up to 30 feet to a space you can see. The avatar appears to travel in a way appropriate to its form if you choose.

Whenever you spend insight, your avatar is empowered until the end of the turn.

While empowered, when a mark from your pattering speech would expire or be removed from a creature in range of your avatar's influence, instead extend the duration until the end of your next turn.

The avatar remains until you lose consciousness, summon another avatar or move more than 60 feet away from each other for more than one minute.

### Fables

> Playtester note: fables are not intended to be a "normal" part of class progression. It is intended that a player that pursues them should have enough to concentrate on but, the power and scope can vary quite a bit. Fables exist because they are the following:
> * a way for the gm to give plot hooks to the players that guarantee a certain reward
> * a way for players to signal to the dm that they want the plot to move in a certain direction
> * a way for the gm to give something to the players that would make the game better but they may not otherwise have access to (languages, spells, waterbreathing, etc.)

Starting at 2nd level, you learn to magically weave fables into your art. You gain the ability to learn and focus on fables. On your adventures, you can learn any number of fables. See downtime activities at the end of this document.

When you focus on a fable you gain its benefits. You may focus on a number of fables, equal to your focus, as shown in the focus column of the Fabulist table. When you finish a short rest, you may focus on a fable you have previously learned. If you are already focusing on a number of fables equal to your focus, you must stop focusing on one fable. When you gain certain Fabulist levels, you gain additional focus, as shown in the focus column of the Fabulist table. 

Fable options are detailed at the end of the class description. If a fable has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the fable at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

### Story Beats

Beginning at 3rd level, you learn to control the rhythm of your stories to impose you will on listeners.

Gain two insight points, you regain all of your expended uses of insight when you finish a long rest. Insight may be used to empower you story beats. When you gain certain Fabulist levels, you gain additional insight points, as shown in the insight column of the Fabulist table. 

Whenever you finish a long rest, choose two of the following story beats:

* **Heartbreak** As a bonus action, choose any number of creatures marked by your pattering speech. Chosen creatures take your resonance die as psychic damage and their mark is removed. You may spend one insight point to forgo rolling and treat all resonance dice as if they rolled the maximum result.

* **Against all odds** As a bonus action, choose any number of creatures marked by your pattering speech. Chosen creatures gain your resonance die as temporary hit points and their mark is removed. You may spend one insight point to forgo rolling and treat all resonance dice as if they rolled the maximum result.

* **Seize the Advantage** As a bonus action, choose a creature marked by your pattering speech. The chosen creature may use their reaction to move up to half their speed and their mark is removed. You may spend one insight point to cause this move to not provoke opportunity attacks.

* **Daring Stratagem** As a bonus action, choose a creature marked by your pattering speech and spend one insight point. The chosen creature may use their reaction to make one attack and their mark is removed. The attacker gains your resonance die as a bonus to the attack roll. If the target of this attack is marked by your pattering speech, the attack deals your resonance die as additional damage and their mark is removed.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

### Unbound Insight

Beginning when you reach 6th level, you regain all of your expended insight when you finish a short or long rest.

### Extra Story Beats

At 7th level, you gain additional story beats.

Whenever you finish a long rest, choose two of the following story beats:

* **Shared** As a reaction, when a creature marked by your pattering speech takes damage, you may spend one insight point to half the damage and the mark is removed. You take an equal amount of damage. This damage may not be reduced in any way.

* **Bolstering** As a reaction, when a creature marked by your pattering speech takes damage, you may spend one insight point to reduce the damage by your resonance die and the mark is removed.

* **Foreboding** As a reaction, when a creature marked by your pattering speech moves closer to you, you may spend one insight point to deal your resonance die in damage and the mark is removed.

* **Disorienting** As a reaction, when a creature marked by your pattering speech ends it's turn without moving, you may spend one insight point to deal your resonance die in damage and the mark is removed.

### The Plot Thickens

Starting at 9th level, once per turn when one of you resonance dice rolls the maximum value, you may spend one insight to reroll the die and add it to the result.

### Draw a Bigger Crowd

Beginning at 11th level, once per turn when you use draw a crowd, you may spend one insight to affect one additional target.

### Reliable Expert

Starting at 14th level, When you would a make skill check using the skill which you add double your proficiency bonus from your a tale for any occasion feature, you may spend one insight to take 10 on the roll.

### Legendary Insight

At 20th level when you roll initiative with no insight points remaining, gain 4 insight points.


## Tips

* Most of the time, you will use your action to use your *pattering speech* but don't be afraid to use it for something more creative.
* If you plan on using a *story beat* that will remove your *marks*, move your *avatar* before-hand to keep as many marks up as possible.
* If you think you may use one of the reaction *story beats* this round, try to position your *avatar* proactively.
* Traveling while within range of your avatar's influence will keep up your marks on allies indefinitely without reapplication.
* Using *draw a crowd* along with good positioning of your *avatar* can really ramp up your effectiveness as a battle goes on.
* Especially before *unbound insight* your *insight* pool is quite limited, it's okay to take a couple turns setting up *marks* before you invest your *insight* points on a move like *against all odds* or *heartbreak*.
* *Against all odds* and *heartbreak* are reliable ways to trigger *the plot thickens*.
* Pick your targets wisely for *daring stratagem*, classes like Paladin and Rogue or two-handed weapon users with the *great weapon master* feat deal tremendous damage even when it isn't their turn.
* *The plot thickens* can potentially be used on the attack roll from *daring stratagem* to mitigate a bad d20 roll.
* Much of your versatility comes from your unique downtime activities. Look for opportunities to invest your downtime to learn new rituals or *fables*. 
* Some fables are intentionally quite a bit stronger than others, its okay. They are all locked behind the downtime activity that your GM has a lot of control over. Great rewards come with high costs, some fables may require difficult quests or other costs.
* Be generous with the rewards from fables. Try to use fables to give plot hooks to your GM and look for the rewards that may benefit your companions more than yourself.

## Fables

Below are some example fable benefits that you and your GM might want to consider. See the advice at the end of the section for further advice on creating or modifying fable options for your own group.

 When you learn a fable, you must name it. See fable names at the end of this document.

* You can cast speak with animals at will.

* You can cast detect magic at will.

* You can cast silent image at will.

* You can cast disguise self at will.

* You can cast mage armor on yourself at will.

* You can spend 2 insight points to cast *pass without trace*.

* You can spend 2 insight points to cast *knock*.

* You can spend 2 insight points to cast *moonbeam*.

* Creatures you choose that are marked by you have their movement speed increased by 10 feet

* Creatures you choose that are marked by you are slowed.

* Creatures you choose that are marked by you are proficient in one saving throw and one skill or tool (choose a saving throw  and skill or tool each time you learn this fable).

* Creatures you choose that are marked by you have the dwarf traits *darkvision*, *dwarven resilience*, and *languages*.

* Creatures you choose that are marked by you have the elf traits *darkvision*, *fey ancestry*, and *languages*.

* Creatures you choose that are marked by you have the halfling traits *brave** and *languages*.

* Creatures you choose that are marked by you have the dragonborn traits *damage resistance* and *languages* (choose a *draconic ancestry* when you learn this fable). 

* Creatures you choose that are marked by you have the gnome traits *darkvision*, *gnome cunning*, and *languages*.

* Creatures you choose that are marked by you have the half-orc traits *darkvision*, *menacing*, and *languages*.

* Creatures you choose that are marked by you have the tiefling traits *darkvision*, *hellish resistance*, and *languages*.

* When you perform the Fabulist's bond ritual on non-magic chain mail, while it is bonded, treat it as a *eleven mail*. You may choose to attune to this item as a part on the ritual.

* When you perform the Fabulist's bond ritual on a non-magic belt, while it is bonded, treat it as a *belt of giant strength*. You may choose to attune to this item as a part on the ritual. 

* When you perform the Fabulist's bond ritual on a non-magic belt, while it is bonded, treat it as a *belt of dwarvenkind*. You may choose to attune to this item as a part on the ritual.

* When you perform the Fabulist's bond ritual on a non-magic stone, while it is bonded, treat it as a single *sending stone* of a pair. This bond does not break from separation.

* When you perform the Fabulist's bond ritual on a non-magic cloak, while it is bonded, treat it as a *cloak of the manta ray*. You may choose to attune to this item as a part on the ritual.

* When you perform the Fabulist's bond ritual on a non-magic vial filled with water, while it is bonded, treat it as a *potion of healing*. This bond breaks when the potion is consumed or the vial is emptied. You may not benefit from this fable again until you have completed a long rest.

> **advice**
> fables Serve two main purposes
>* reward groups for learning new things about the world
>* signal the GM what type of content you want
>
> Some fables might give you limited access to spell casting.
>
> Many of these still require material components. Be sure to stock up.
>
> 1st-level buff and utility spells or spells that would often be cast as rituals can usually be cast at will without too much breaking. However, spells with damage or healing components can quickly get out of control if given in this way.
>
> a spell like *mage armor* works best if you restrict it usage to just the caster
>
> Higher level spell should be castable by using one insight per level of the spell. Take a look at the spells level and consider whether you group is high enough to have access to each spell. I still recommend buff and utility spells but, some damage or healing creeping in might make sense if the flavor matches your campaign. I would still leave the heavy hitting spells like fireball, counterspell, cure wounds, etc. to the specialists.
>
> But if everyone agrees they need a heavy hitter like fireball, increase the cost and severely limit the use.
> * *Requirements: level 5*
> You can spend 4 insight points to cast *fireball*. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
>
> Some fables might empower your maked targets.
> 
> These bonus can have very high uptime in combat so, try to keep them relatively subtle.
>
> This fable is great for a story about an individual who embodies their class ideals. Pick a saving throw and a skill or tool from that class.
>
> These fables let you gain some understanding of what makes a culture tick. The examples here are right out of the player handbook. However, not all dwarves are the same so, I would encourage you to change up what these traits mean or to use different ones appropriate to your setting. When creating this kind of fable try to include the following traits if applicable: 
> * an environmental trait such as, *darkvision* or *amphibious*
> * a defensive trait such as, *dwarven resilience* or *brave*
> * the *languages* trait
>
> Some fables let you use your Fabulist's bond feature to create magic items
>
> The permanent magic items should follow similar guidelines to how they would normally be rewarded in your game. The major difference is that this is a contract between the players and the GM. The player's say what they want and the GM provides them with a concrete method to obtain it.
>
> I would recommend that some items may be more easily rewarded because they open up possibilities that would otherwise be unavailable.
>
> Consumables can also be rewarded, possibly requiring more exotic reagents.


## Downtime Activities

Fabulists have access to the following special downtime activities:

### Diligent Fabulist

You may use the researching downtime activity to gain new understanding of fables. When you complete this activity, you learn a new fable. Well known fables in a rich research environments take one day of research, do not require a skill check and do not require completing an additional task.

### The Story Continues

A Fabulist's work is never done. As long as the world remains there are new tales to tell.

While in the company of those unfamiliar with your recent adventures, you may recount the stories that you have picked up.

Gain benefits as per the Practicing a Profession downtime activity. When you complete this activity, you may work towards learning a spell with the ritual tag from any class where the spell’s level is equal to or less than half your Fabulist level (rounded up). Expend 50 gp for the materials needed in the process and mark one progress towards the learning of the spell. When you have accumulated progress equal to the level of the spell, it is recorded to your Fabulist's tool.

## Items

When you perform the Fabulist's bond ritual on an appropriately similar non-magic version of these items, while it is bonded, treat it as your *Fabulist's tool* with the properties of the associated item. This use of the Fabulist's bond ritual doesn't count towards your bond limit. However, only one item may be bonded as your *Fabulist's tool* at a time.

### Fang of the serpent

*wonderous item*

Every morning at dawn, this item produces a single drop of clear liquid. Any inspection of this liquid reveals it is water; however, when mixed with ink, it imbues the ink with special properties only when used by a character with Fabulist's touch. 

When images or words are recorded using this ink on a suitable surface, the ink instantly disappears and is stored in the surface. When a character with Fabulist's touch  touches a surface containing a stored image, they can choose any stored image to appear as an action. This image is perfectly recreated as lines and colors wriggle into place. This image remains only so long as the character stays in contact with the surface. Images are animated by the movement of writhing lines in accordance with the creators intentions. Interacting with a surface in this way counts are using Fabulist's tools.

### Quilt of many squares

*wonderous item*

When a character with Fabulist's touch unfolds this quilt, the patches depict the story of their choosing. Interacting with the quilt in this way counts are using Fabulist's tools.

### Gloves of Shadow Puppets

*wonderous item*

These gloves do not fit anyone unless they are bonded through the Fabulist's touch ritual.

The shadow puppets cast by these gloves are astoundingly realistic and visible in full sunlight. The wearer may record a performance by speaking the name of a new story as a command word. The wearer may reenact a recorded performance by speaking a stored command word. The wearer then knows how to recreate a recorded performance including but not limited to gestures, music and narration. The recreated version can be literal or a translated version. Something may be lost in the translation, at the DM's discretion. Interacting with the gloves in this way counts are using Fabulist's tools.

## Fable Names

> Very early probably not needed but tables are always cool.

1. To generate your fable title begin with the following structure:

	[scale][character] is motivated by [reason]. [scale][character] is in conflict because [reason]. Conflict is resolved using [method].

2. Roll or choose a value for each set of brackets from the table indicated.

3. Consider how, along with your chosen fable benefit, these elements fit together to form a story.

4. Name the important elements of your story. Important elements may include the characters, locations, or objects in the story. The names could be proper names or descriptive.
